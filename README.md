3->I'm learning web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve started exploring frameworks like React. To practice, I work on small projects, like creating personal websites or simple applications. In the future, I want to work on bigger projects, collaborate with others in a team, and learn backend technologies like Node.js or Django so I can become a full-stack developer.
